            "In those days, there also lived an old soldier called Jack Hannaford. His coat was old and he was poor, but nobody thought that Jack Hannaford was stupid. He was sly like a fox. When he left the army, he walked all around the country, looking for ways to play his tricks.",
            "After he had traveled for some time, he came across the farm belonging to the pair. He knocked on the door of the house, and a moment later, the wife answered. She looked him up and down, quite astonished, because few strangers were able  to make the difficult journey to their home. “Where did you come from?” she asked."

Oh yes, I got to know him well when I was staying in Heaven,” said Jack. “And how is he doing?”, asked the woman. “He is fine,” replied the old soldier."

That is why I’ve come here. He asked me to bring back some money for him, so that he can spend his days in paradise more comfortably.” On hearing this, the poor woman’s heart almost broke with pity."

She took out two pieces of gold and five pieces of silver, which in those days was a lot of money. She handed everything over to the old soldier and told him to hurry up and give it to her first husband. “I will,” Jack told the woman, “as soon as I return to Heaven.”"

            "“How could you believe such a silly story?” “Well, you are even more foolish,” said the woman, “because you showed me where the money was hidden.” The husband did not agree with what she said, but he did not stay to argue. He hurried off on his horse to try to find the old soldier before he got too far away."

He knelt by the side of the road, covered his eyes with one hand, and pointed up to the sky with the other. The farmer soon reached him and asked: “What are you doing here by the side of the road? Why are you protecting your eyes and pointing up to the sky?” “It is amazing! It is God’s work!” shouted the man. “I see a wonderful thing!” “What kind of wonderful thing?” asked the farmer. “A man is walking straight up to Heaven on a rainbow, just as if it were a road.“"

As soon as the farmer knelt down, Jack Hannaford jumped onto the horse and escaped! Now, who do you think was more foolish, the farmer or his wife?"

And no matterwhat the story was about, he never grew tired of hearing it, even thoughmany of the stories took hours to complete. “There is only one fault with yourstory,” he often said, “it is too short.” All the storytellers in the world wereinvited to his palace; and some of them told stories that were very longindeed."

He said: “To the man that will tell me a story which lasts forever, I will give my daughter as his wife; and I will make him my heir, and he shall be king after me.” But this challenge wasn’t quite what it seemed. The King added a strict condition. “If any man tries to tell such a story and fails, then his head will be cut off.”."

But none of them wanted to lose his head, and so only a few tried for the prize. One young man invented a story that lasted three months; but after that, he could think of nothing more. His fate was a warning to others, and it was a long time before another storyteller was daring enough to take the King's challenge."
